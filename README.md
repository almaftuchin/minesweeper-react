### [Rules of MineSweeper](https://gist.github.com/lionel-lints/1b520163e892bf7913f594bd76363ff8)

### Leaderboards
- Using Cheat - Defuse Mine ðŸ‘€ will not count.
- Score will only be recorded if user's logged in - using Facebook login.

### Defuse Mine ðŸ‘€
Easy win but meh

### Server code for Leaderboard
Using Heroku.
- Pros: fast and free.
- Cons: The Heroku filesystem is ephemeral - that means that any changes to the filesystem whilst the dyno is running only last until that dyno is shut down or restarted. Each dyno boots with a clean copy of the filesystem from the most recent deploy. Leaderboard will be reset. ðŸ˜¢
